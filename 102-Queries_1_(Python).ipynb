    "## About `Get` queries\n",
    "In many use cases, retrieving objects from a Weaviate instance may be the most common operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a user may want to retrieve a list of passages most closely related to the input query, or they may wish to retrieve a list of images which are most similar to another image. It is even possible to retrieve a set of images that best match a given passage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Weaviate, such operations to retrieve objects are performed using the `Get` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Get` function syntax\n",
    "A basic `Get` function looks as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = client.query.get(\n",
    "    <Class>,\n",
    "    [<properties>]\n",
    ").<arguments>.do()\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `Class` field specifies the name of the class of objects to be retrieved.\n",
    "- The `arguments` argument specifies the search criteria to be used to retrieve the objects.\n",
    "- The `properties` argument specifies the properties of the objects to be retrieved, including any `_additional` properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's try out some concrete `Get` queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standalone `Get` queries\n",
