    "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/setup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Follow this short guide to make sure that you are set up to use Weaviate with the Python client.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python & Python client\n",
    "If you have not yet set up Python and the Weaviate Python client, follow the below instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Python\n",
    "You can install Python 3 in a variety of ways. One easy way is to use an appropriate installer for your system as per instructions on [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install the Weaviate client\n",
    "> VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS<br>It is best practice to use virtual environments to isolate projects.<br>If you're not familiar with virtual environments, we highly recommend reading up on them - this tutorial on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/) is a good resource, as is this article on [RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/), which goes a little more in-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "`weaviate-client`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Activate your virtual environment, and install the Weaviate client with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install weaviate-client`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running your Python code\n",
    "We recommend running Python code in a Jupyter notebook. You can install the library by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Then running the shown code in a Jupyter notebook. Of course, you can also run it in any way that you prefer.\n",
    "> NEW TO JUPYTER?<br>To learn how to use Jupyter notebooks, [try this tutorial](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weaviate\n",
    "### Instance access\n",
    "We will be accessing a pre-built instance of Weaviate throughout the course, located at [https://edu-demo.weaviate.network](https://edu-demo.weaviate.network).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the instance with the below code, using a read-only Weaviate API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirm that you can run the below code, to make sure it is all functioning as expected."
