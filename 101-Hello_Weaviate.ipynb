    "### Vector database\n",
    "Weaviate is a fantastic tool for retrieving the information you need, quickly and accurately. It does this by being an amazing **vector database**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be familiar with traditional databases such as relational databases that use SQL. A database can catalog, store and retrieve information. A **vector** database can carry out these tasks also, with the key difference being that they can perform these tasks based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How traditional searches work\n",
    "Imagine that you are searching a relational database containing articles on cities, to retrieve a list of \"major\" European cities. Using SQL, you might construct a query like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT city_name wiki_summary\n",
    "FROM wiki_city\n",
    "WHERE (wiki_summary LIKE '%major European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%important European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%prominent European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%leading European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%significant European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%top European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%influential European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%notable European city%')\n",
    "    (â€¦ and so on)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which would return cities that contained any of these strings (`major`, `important`, `prominent`, ... etc) in the `wiki_summary` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works well in many circumstances. However, there are two significant limitations with this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations of traditional search\n",
    "Using this type of search requires you to identify terms that may have been used to describe the concept, which is no easy feat.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, this doesn't solve the problem of how to rank the list of resulting objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above search query, an entry merely containing a mention of a different European city (i.e. not very relevant) would be given equal weighting to an entry for Paris, or Rome, which would be highly relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector database makes this job simpler by enabling searches based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of vector search\n",
    "So, you could perform a query like this in Weaviate:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  Get {\n",
    "    WikiCity (\n",
    "      nearText: { concepts: [\"Major European city\"] }\n",
    "    ) { city_name wiki_summary }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And it would return a list of entries that are ranked by their similarity to the query - the idea of \"Major European city\".\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, Weaviate \"indexes\" the data based on their similarity, making this type of data retrieval lightning-fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate can help you to do all this, and actually a lot more. Another way to think about Weaviate is that it supercharges the way you use information.\n",
    "\n",
    "> VECTOR VS SEMANTIC SEARCH<br>\n",
    "A vector search is also referred to as a \"semantic search\" because it returns results based on the similarity of meaning (therefore \"semantic\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open-source\n",
    "Weaviate is open-source. In other words, its [codebase is available online](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) for anyone to see and use [$^{\\rm{1}}$](https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/hello_weaviate/intro_weaviate#1).\n",
    "\n",
    "And that is the codebase, regardless of how you use it. So whether you run Weaviate on your own computer, on a cloud computing environment, or through our managed service [Weaviate Cloud Services, or WCS](https://console.weaviate.io/), you are using the exact same technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you want, you can run Weaviate for free on your own device, or use our managed service for convenience. You can also take comfort in that you can see exactly what you are running, and be a part of the open-source community, as well as to shape its development.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also means that your knowledge about Weaviate is fungible, between local, cloud, or managed instances of Weaviate. So anything you learn here about Weaviate using WCS will be equally applicable to running it locally, and vice versa. ðŸ˜‰\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information, made dynamic\n",
    "We are used to thinking of information as static, like a book. But with Weaviate and modern AI-driven language models, we can do much more than just retrieve static information but easily build on top of it. Take a look at these examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question answering\n",
    "Given a list of Wikipedia entries, you could ask Weaviate:\n",
    "> When was Lewis Hamilton born?\n",
    "\n",
    "And it would answer with:\n",
    "> Lewis Hamilton was born on January 7, 1985. ([check for yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton))\n",

    "          \"wiki_summary\": \"Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton   (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver currently competing in Formula One, driving for Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team. In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (103), and podium finishes (191), among others.\\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren young driver programme in 1998 at the age of 13, becoming the youngest racing driver ever to be contracted by a Formula One team. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren for six years from 2007 to 2012, making Hamilton the first black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi R\\u00e4ikk\\u00f6nen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion\\u2014making a crucial overtake at the last corner on the last lap of the last race of the season\\u2014to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history.  After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.\\nChanges to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, in which Hamilton twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles. Hamilton achieved his 100th pole position and race win during the 2021 season. \\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of activism to combat racism and push for increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was the highest-paid Formula One driver from 2013 to 2021, and was ranked as one of the world's highest-paid athletes by Forbes of twenty-tens decade and 2021. He was also listed in the 2020 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours. Hamilton was granted honorary Brazilian citizenship in 2022.\\n\\n\"\n",

    "We've covered that Weaviate is a vector database, and that a vector search is similarity-based. But what is a vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector in this context is just a series of numbers - like `[1, 0]` or `[0.513, 0.155, 0.983, ..., 0.001, 0.932]`. Vectors like these are used to capture meaning as a series of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem like an odd concept. But in fact, many people have used vectors already without realizing - for example if they have tried photo editing, or MS Paint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do numbers represent meaning?\n",
    "The RGB system use numbers to represent colors. For example:\n",
    "- `(255, 0, 0)` = red\n",
    "- `(80, 200, 120)` = emerald\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, each number can be thought of as a dial for how red, green or blue a color is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine having hundreds, or even thousands of these dials. Thatâ€™s how vectors are used to represent meaning. Modern models such as GPT-x, or those used with Weaviate use vectors in this manner to represent some \"essence\", or \"meaning\" of objects. And this can be done for any object type, such as text, code, images, videos and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each vector representation of such \"meaning\" is called a vector embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector embeddings in Weaviate\n",
    "Weaviate enables vector searches by indexing and storing data objects and corresponding vector embeddings from machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain terms, Weaviate processes and organizes your data in such a way that objects can be retrieved based on their similarity to a query. In order for it to perform these tasks at speed, Weaviate does two things that traditional databases do not. They are:\n",
    "- Quantifying similarity, and\n",
    "- Indexing vector data\n",
    "\n",
    "These aspects enable Weaviate to do what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantifying similarity\n",
    "As we've mentioned, vector searches are similarity-based, but what does that actually mean? How do we determine that two pieces of data are \"similar\"? What does it mean for two pieces of text, two images, or two objects in general, to be similar?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a relatively simple idea that is actually incredibly interesting and intricate once we start to dive into the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for now, you should know that machine learning (ML) models are key to this whole process. Similar models to those that allows clever text generation from prompts power vector searches. Instead of generating new text, here these models capture \"meaning\" of pieces of text or other media. We will cover this in more detail later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing (vector) data\n",
    "Vector searches can be very computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this problem, Weaviate uses a combination of indexes including an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) index and an inverted index. They respectively allow Weaviate to perform extremely fast vector searches, as well as to filter data using Boolean criteria on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will get into this in more detail later - but for now, it's enough to know that Weaviate can perform fast vector searches as well as filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review\n",
    "In this section, you learned about what vectors are and how Weaviate utilizes them at a very high level. You have also been introduced to Weaviate's two key capabilities that helps it to enable vector search at speed.\n",

    "### Review exercise\n",
    "> Can you describe, in your own words, what vectors are?<br><br>My answer:<br>A vector of dimension $n$ is a list of $n$ numbers and thus can be interpreted as a dot in $n$-dimensional space. In the context of artificial intelligence, vectors have many use cases, among them the representation of *embeddings*, i.e., a mathematical represnetation of tokens (sub-words). Creating \"good\" embeddings â€“ that is embeddings that relate to each other like the sub-words they represent (e.g., \"king\" should relate to \"queen\" like \"man\" to \"woman\") â€“ for a set of tokens is paramount to natural language processing and other areas of machine learning. \n",

    "Let's take a look at a few more examples of what you can do with Weaviate.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will try vector searches by searching through our demo database. You will learn how to use Weaviate to retrieve objects based on their similarity, using various query types such as an input text, vector, or object.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also compare vector search with keyword search to compare and contrast the two techniques, before learning how to combine the two techniques through the use of filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector search demo\n",
    "For our first example, let's look through our demo dataset which contains a small sample of questions from the quiz show Jeopardy!.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you're running a quiz night, and want to get some questions around the category of \"animals in movies\". You could look for word matches - perhaps something like:\n",

    "SELECT question, answer\n",
    "FROM jeopardy_questions\n",

    "AND (question LIKE '%movie%' OR question LIKE '%film%' OR question LIKE '%picture%' OR question LIKE '%cinema%')\n",
    "```\n",
