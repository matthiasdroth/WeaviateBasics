Joon-Pil Hwang (Weaviate)

As promised, I include:
• The demo app notebook (https://github.com/databyjp/knowledge_space/blob/main/demo_notebook.ipynb)
• The live-coded notebook (https://github.com/databyjp/knowledge_space/blob/main/demo_workshop_live.ipynb)
• The Weaviate capabilities demo (https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/intro-workshop/blob/main/1_weaviate_examples.ipynb), and
• The video recording (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d2P1gBJzOJDL9CzgU91oLdaM6dnrCbLw/view?usp=sharing)

Please note that the knowledge-manager app is my personal demo project and is very much a work-in-progress.
