    "Weaviate is an open-source vector database. But what does that mean? Let's unpack it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector database\n",
    "Weaviate is a fantastic tool for retrieving the information you need, quickly and accurately. It does this by being an amazing **vector database**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be familiar with traditional databases such as relational databases that use SQL. A database can catalog, store and retrieve information. A **vector** database can carry out these tasks also, with the key difference being that they can perform these tasks based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How traditional searches work\n",
    "Imagine that you are searching a relational database containing articles on cities, to retrieve a list of \"major\" European cities. Using SQL, you might construct a query like this:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT city_name wiki_summary\n",
    "FROM wiki_city\n",
    "WHERE (wiki_summary LIKE '%major European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%important European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%prominent European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%leading European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%significant European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%top European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%influential European city%' OR\n",
    "       wiki_summary LIKE '%notable European city%')\n",
    "    (… and so on)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which would return cities that contained any of these strings (`major`, `important`, `prominent`, ... etc) in the `wiki_summary` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works well in many circumstances. However, there are two significant limitations with this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations of traditional search\n",
    "Using this type of search requires you to identify terms that may have been used to describe the concept, which is no easy feat.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, this doesn't solve the problem of how to rank the list of resulting objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above search query, an entry merely containing a mention of a different European city (i.e. not very relevant) would be given equal weighting to an entry for Paris, or Rome, which would be highly relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector database makes this job simpler by enabling searches based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of vector search\n",
    "So, you could perform a query like this in Weaviate:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  Get {\n",
    "    WikiCity (\n",
    "      nearText: { concepts: [\"Major European city\"] }\n",
    "    ) { city_name wiki_summary }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "And it would return a list of entries that are ranked by *their similarity* to the query - the idea of \"Major European city\".\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, Weaviate \"indexes\" the data based on their similarity, making this type of data retrieval lightning-fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate can help you to do all this, and actually a lot more. Another way to think about Weaviate is that it supercharges the way you use information.\n",
    "> VECTOR VS SEMANTIC SEARCH<br>\n",
    "A vector search is also referred to as a \"semantic search\" because it returns results based on the similarity of meaning (therefore \"semantic\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open-source\n",
    "Weaviate is open-source. In other words, its [codebase is available online](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) for anyone to see and use $^\\href{https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/hello_weaviate/intro_weaviate#1}{(1)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that is *the* codebase, regardless of how you use it. So whether you run Weaviate on your own computer, on a cloud computing environment, or through our managed service Weaviate Cloud Services, or WCS, you are using the exact same technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you want, you can run Weaviate for free on your own device, or use our managed service for convenience. You can also take comfort in that you can see exactly what you are running, and be a part of the open-source community, as well as to shape its development.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also means that your knowledge about Weaviate is fungible, between local, cloud, or managed instances of Weaviate. So anything you learn here about Weaviate using WCS will be equally applicable to running it locally, and vice versa. 😉"
