    "## Troubleshooting & FAQs\n",
    "We provide answers to some common questions, or potential issues below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to confirm class creation**\n",
    "> If you are not sure whether the class has been created, you can confirm it by visiting the [`schema` endpoint](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/rest/schema) here (replace the URL with your actual endpoint):<br>*https://some-endpoint.weaviate.network/v1/schema*<br><br>You should see:<br>`{`<br>`    \"classes\": [`<br>`        {`<br>`            \"class\": \"Question\",`<br>`            ...  // truncated additional information here`<br>`            \"vectorizer\": \"text2vec-huggingface\"`<br>`        }`<br>`    ]`<br>`}`<br>Where the schema should indicate that the `Question` class has been added.<br><br>REST & GRAPHQL IN WEAVIATE<br>Weaviate uses a combination of RESTful and GraphQL APIs. In Weaviate, RESTful API endpoints can be used to add data or obtain information about the Weaviate instance, and the GraphQL interface to retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you see `Error: Name 'Question' already used as a name for an Object class`**\n",
    "> You may see this error if you try to create a class that already exists in your instance of Weaviate. In this case, you can delete the class following the below instructions.<br><br>You can delete any unwanted class(es), along with the data that they contain.<br><br>DELETING A CLASS == DELETING ITS OBJECTS<br>Know that **deleting a class will also delete all associated objects**!<br>Do not do this to a production database, or anywhere where you do not wish to delete your data.<br>Run the code below to delete the relevant class and its objects.<br><br>`client.schema.delete_class(\"YourClassName\") # Replace with your class name - e.g. \"Question\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to confirm data import**\n",
    "> To confirm successful data import, navigate to the [`objects` endpoint](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/rest/objects) to check that all objects have been imported (replace with your actual endpoint):<br>`https://some-endpoint.weaviate.network/v1/objects`<br>You should see:<br><br>`{`<br>`    \"deprecations\": null,`<br>`    \"objects\": [`<br>`        ... // details of each object`<br>`    ],`<br>`    \"totalResults\": 10 // You should see 10 results here`<br>`}`<br><br>Where you should be able to confirm that you have imported all `10` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the `nearText` search is not working**\n",
    "> To perform text-based (`nearText`) similarity searches, you need to have a vectorizer enabled, and configured in your class.<br>Make sure you configured it as shown in [this section](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart#define-a-class).<br>If it still doesn't work - please [reach out to us](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart#more-resources)!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Will my sandbox be deleted?**\n",
    "> SANDBOX EXPIRY<br>The sandbox is free, but it will expire after 14 days. After this time, all data in the sandbox will be deleted.<br>If you would like to preserve your sandbox data, you can [retrieve your data](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/manage-data/read-all-objects), or [contact us to upgrade](https://weaviate.io/pricing#register) to a production SaaS instance.\n",
